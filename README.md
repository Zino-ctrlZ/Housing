# The Aparment Ranker.
This app makes use of react features such as useReducer, useState, and useEffect to develop a location ranker app. This location ranker app makes use of google maps api to display a route from a location to a centralized location. 


# Motivations for development
This process of the development of this app was used to learn useReducer aqnd the google maps api. I began learning during an apartment hunt phase and this felt like a good way to mix a learning process with something that matters to me.
